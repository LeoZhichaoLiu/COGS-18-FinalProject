    "#### 2) Guess vocabulary:\n",
    " Normally this game should involve two players: player 1 and player 2\n",
    " For player 1, he or she should enter a vocabulary as string to the system. And system will record that vocabulary.\n",
    " Then, player 2 will come and try to guess that vocabulary.\n",
    " The system will give player 2 the hint that showing a hiding vocabulary. * indicate this letter has not been \n",
    " guessed. \n",
    " In each turn, player 2 can enter a single letter to guess that vocabulary. If vocabulary contains that letter,\n",
    " the corresponding vocabulary position will change from * to that letter.\n",
    " If the player 2 guess the whole vocabulary, which means all letters change from * to specific letter, the player\n",
    " 2 win the game."
